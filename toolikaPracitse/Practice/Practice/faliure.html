            I got to develop a totally new feature. During discussion with stake holders i was not very clear with the requirement but I didn't ask much questions then.
            With the discussion and understanding my team decided the design it was new and complex design so it was 2 week full dedication 
            during review we found out the gap in understanding was big and relese was delayed.
            Luckily the stake holders were generous to give us more time to correct 
            But I learned a leasson in hard way to ask all doubts until both parties are on same page

            In my 3rd year project I choose a topic  water pollution control system using digital image processing.
            The topic was new to me as well I learned the matlab and image processing after months of research on microspoic organism and technology
            I made model which tell all the microsopic organisms which were present in water using there microscopic images. 
            My project was failure a
            1st -> I was not able to get much microscopic images of real water bodies to present real use case
            2nd -> there was just identification of microscopic organisms not a control to water pollution.

            Good thing that happend was I was able to publish my work as research paper in springer after college

            We had a requirement of feedback functionality and if manger accepts then we had redo the audit.
            the audit involved several steps and once all the steps were done then only audit was considered completed.
            During this steps we generate lot of data.
            In design presented by  colleague was first step as docketing manager accepting and rejecting the feedback.
